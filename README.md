# Rick-Morty-Api-Exercise VUE
## Challenger week 4 Empathy Academy Front-End Path

This challenge is developed with VUE framework

### Requirements from this challenge:
* Create Basic HTML and CSS structure in App.vue without any logic. ✅
* Modify text input so it makes API calls to [rick & morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) using the
   [filter endpoint](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#filter-characters). Save the results and print the characters by console. ✅
* Paint dynamically with `v-for` the characters with its name, status and image. ✅
* Modify the filters so they use the filters inside characters and print them dynamically with `v-for`. Make the filters work also.👨🏻‍💻
* Move each filter, character card and input to a separate component but ensure the application works properly after these changes.✅
* Make one API call per filter, following API specification.
* Put `CharacterCard` inside a `Grid` component to use `slots`.

### Bonus requirements

* Create `FilterList` component that allowed us to change the component used in the `v-for`.
* Add fade-in transitions to the filters using the `Transition` components pre-built on Vue.
* Add a button on the page so it shows a list of all the episodes. Everything else should remain the same.
